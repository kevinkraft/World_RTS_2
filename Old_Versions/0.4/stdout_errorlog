can reproduce error by collecting, the interaction between eating and collecting causes the problem. Something to do with the exchange inserted into the action list by the collect.

#UNIT ALREADY HAS AN EAT ORDER SO A NEW ONE ISN'T ADDED AND WE MOVE ON TO THE ACTIONS LOOP
#LOOP OVER UNIT YOUS ACTIONS FIRST AS HE IS FIRST IN THE ENTITY LIST
#HIS EAT ACTION IS AT THE FRONT OF THE QUEUE SO WE WILL END UP IN THE EAT SECTION
#we go into DoEat
#INVENTORY IS NOT EMPTY BECAUSE UNITPROBABLY HAS SOME MAR RESOURCE, SO WE CHECK FOR FOOD AND FIND NONE
#SO NO FOOD EATEN AND FOOD ORDER ISNT DELETED
#STOCKPILE HAS FOOD SO WE GO INTO THAT SECTION
#SKIP RETURN TO BUILDING PART AS THE UNIT HAS In_Building = False
#OUR POS IS THE SAME AS THE STOCKPILE SO WE SKIP THE MOVE PART
#SO WE GO INTO eat.AutomaticFoodExchange()

#RETURN TRUE, RETURN NOTHING FROM DoEat BACK TO main.py 
#WE NOW GO ON TO JO'S ACTIONS. THERE ARE A FEW POSSIBILITIES, 
#1) STILL EATING INVENTORY(POSSIBLE)
#2) FINISHED EATING INVENTORY AND IS FULL (NO)
#   I) FOOD HAS SIZE 1 AND HE HAD A FULL INVENTORY, SO HE HAD 5 FOOD, IS THIS ENOUGH TO FILL JO?
#   II) (EAT SPEED)*(FOOD HUNGER VALUE) = (0.01)*(10) = 0.1 PER CYCLE, PER 0.01 FOOD 5/0.01 = 500, 500*0.1 = 50, SO IT MAY NOT HAVE FILLED HIM 
#   III) HIS HUNGER GOT DOWN TO 50, AND WHILE HE WAS IT EATING IT DECREASED FURTHER, SO WHEN HE HAD FINISHED EATING THE FOOD IN HIS INVENTORY HE#        PROBABLY HAD ABOUT 95 HUNGER, SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE STOPPED EATING
#3) FINISHED EATING INVENTORY AND IS NOT FULL (POSSIBLE)
#-------------------------------------------------------------
#1) SEE BELOW, THIS APPEARS TO BE NOTHING TO DO WITH JO, ITS AN EXCHANGE WITH YOU THAT CAUSES THE PROBLEM. SKIP ALL OF JO'S PARTS
#-------------------------------------------------------------
#SO YOUS INVENTORY HAS AN EXCHANGE AT THE FRONT, THEN AN EAT, THEN A MOVE BACK TO COLLECT MAR, THEN A COLLECT
#SO IN THE ACTION LOOP WE GO INTO MAKE ORDER EXCHANGE
#BELOW OUTPUT IS PRODUCED
